1. Accept cookies popup modal
If it's not handled properly, it can fail the test run. Test may fail with ElementClickInterceptedException

2. Without proper explicit waits, the test may fail with find_element because not all elements are immediately present
in DOM.

3. File upload automation
It's not recommended to automate file uploads. It requires navigation through the OS file upload window which Selenium
WebDriver doesn't support. Also, uploading large files can take a long time.

4. Accessing the page and submitting the form requires stable internet connection.

5. All prerequisites named in readme file should be installed and configured properly so that the test can run
successfully.
